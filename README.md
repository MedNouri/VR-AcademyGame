VRAcademyGame is an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience developed during my internship in 2018, designed to educate and entertain players in a virtual school environment. Built using Unity and SteamVR Plugin SDK targeting the HTC Vive headset, this game allows players to explore, learn, and engage in interactive challenges.
